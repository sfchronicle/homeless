	<p>01 Everything is a challenge when you live on the streets. There’s no microwave, no place to cook, no refrigerator, no place to do laundry, no rest from the noise on the streets. There’s no restroom. There’s constantly something. It’s hard to keep a job — and getting a job often requires a car or identification, things that Deanna Daly, 31, doesn’t have. “There’s a lot of things you have to do to survive (on the streets). Every little thing is like work.”</p>
	<p>02 John White (left) and Ariel Young moved to Division Street in April, when a few people lived there. White, 51, says that by June it was kind of crowded and then it thinned out, but it’s nothing like it is now. Now, there’s no space at all on the sidewalk. Young, 30, is pregnant, and the couple are trying to find a place to live.</p>
	<p>03 Tony Roberson has seen the ebb and flow of homelessness in San Francisco for most of his life. He is 63 and became homeless two years ago. “I’ve never seen as many tent cities up under the freeways, out at the park.” Roberson was priced out of his home and now sees firsthand the struggles of being homeless. “You got people that are mentally disturbed,” he said. “They don’t have an advocate to speak for them and they get frustrated and just say, ‘the hell with it,’ and they just go to the streets and that’s really sad. ... Can I see San Francisco getting any better as far as the homeless? I hope and pray. That’s all I can do. There’s a lot of things in the city that need to be fixed, but you got to do them one at a time.”</p>
	<p>04 “I hate to say the American system is failing, but I think it is. I’ve been homeless since August of last year,” says Daniel Pledger, 65. “I’m on the shelter list. I was number 785 on the list, but now I’m number 564. San Francisco is the crazy capitol, but for all that, it’s all right. I think the youth of today have isolated themselves with all their devices and that has changed the way people treat each other. I’m an invisible man.”</p>
	<p>05 Dawn Towner and her son, David, had been living on the streets for a year when a Homeless Outreach Team found them at Florida and Treat streets and made them an offer they couldn’t pass up: Come to the Navigation Center where they could not only have a place to sleep, but also work with case managers. Towner, 54, and her son nearly missed their ride to the center in the Mission District, but made it. “I had to keep pinching myself because I thought that was the best that it was ever going to get again,” she said. “I was so accepting the fact that I was going to be on the street the rest of my life, and I still can’t believe that we’re here.”</p>
	<p>06 For David Tompkins, the temporary homeless shelter at Pier 80 was a place to find himself again. “People say I’m changing, but I’m not really changing. When you’re out there, you become something you’re not,” says Tompkins, 56. “I’m becoming me again.” The shelter allowed him to bring his dog, provided him access to a clinic and a place to sleep, and he received the care he needed.</p>
	<p>07 NOT READY FOR WEB</p>
	<p>08 “I decided I’m not going to die in the streets. I’m going to trust in the system and give Pier 80 a try,” said Donald Abel, 60. Pier 80 is a temporary homeless shelter the city set up in February. It allows people to stay with their partners, pets and belongings, and case managers visit residents daily. The shelter is expected to close July 1.</p>
	<p>09 (temporary br tags to represent new grafs) Erik Otten lost his job, his family, his home, his cars. “I was stripped for everything, and I was spit out into being homeless.” That’s how he found St. Anthony’s, the social services organization that helps the poor. He arrived there alone, struggling with sobriety.<br>
	He recalls standing in line at St. Anthony’s Dining Room in the Tenderloin and seeing a woman carrying a Winnie the Pooh stuffed animal. “I remember staring at the animal like, ‘Damn, what happened, man?’ I missed my wife, she was my best friend. I loved my job, I lost it. ... Loved my family, lost that. Had a house, lost. ... I was just reflecting on everything I lost and why I was this drug addict,” he recalls. Nearly five years later — and now an employee at St. Anthony’s — he saw the same lady in line. “I just got the chills, like God ran through me, like, ‘Yeah, you’re on the other side.’<br>
	“I talk to the guys all the time like how far I’ve come, and do my best not to make them like feel alone,” he says.</p>
	<p>10 (br tags here too) “People around here are great,” says Christine Boyer, 52. “They are very forgiving, and they help us every day. I mean every day. It’s just a normal living. Even though we don’t live in a house, it still feels more normal than it did” when her family was at an encampment on Potrero Avenue and Cesar Chavez Street. Her family now stays in the Financial District.<br>
	“I keep a sign on our cart that says that we’re a homeless family with a disabled son and that we need food and blankets and clothing and stuff, and there’s always little surprise gift bags outside our cart when we get up in the mornings. Sometimes shoes, sometimes blankets, clothes, most of the time food, and there’s always at least one person a day that comes by and drops off a $20 bill. ... Sometimes I get a snicker and I’m like, ‘Are you laughing at me?’ and they’re like, ‘Pfffff.’ And I’m like, ‘Would you like to meet my son? He’s right there on the sidewalk where we live. Right there. You can go meet him and judge for yourself.’ They usually apologize and give me a dollar and then walk on.”</p>
	<p>11 “It’s difficult being homeless,” says Alberto Terrell, 55. “I have medical problems and I needed a new pair of shoes, and that is the honest to God truth. It’s hard, but you know what, if you try to at least go to some of the places that will help you, you feel a little better. ... It’s good because I have a quarter of a bone missing in my leg, so new shoes help me balance because I have a lift in my left leg. It will be very helpful, and I really appreciate it.”</p>
	<p>12 As a nurse, Ashley Moore-Motte, 32, would sometimes work intensely with patients for 12 hours and never see them again. But she wanted more. She wanted to feel the connections she made in nursing school when she spent a rotation working at the Empress Hotel, a supportive-housing program where she got to know her patients and understood the challenges they faced in managing their health. Moore-Motte is a primary-care nurse for UCSF and works at Rene Cazenave Apartments, which provides supportive services for the formerly chronically homeless. “With a place like this, I get to make connections with people over time; see them grow, see them fall, and really be a part of a family,” she says. “Having stable food, clothing, and shelter makes it so that you can start to actually pay attention to your health and your well-being, and get your diabetes under control or get your HIV levels to an undetectable level.”</p>
	<p>13 (br tags) Annice Jacoby was walking down Mission Street on a gorgeous day, and sprawled on the sidewalk was a man, passed out and surrounded by broken glass.<br>
	“I was horrified that he was going to roll over and cut himself, and there were dozens of people just walking around him and that was so disturbing. I picked up the glass and I had this thought that I wanted him under cover. I wanted him protected,” she said. That’s how she came up with the idea of Undercover, which provides blankets to people on the streets with messages that call attention to homelessness.<br>
	“This is something that we can fix. The opportunity and the challenge is to the whole city to use our creativity and ingenuity to address this, not in 10-year plans but immediately,” Jacoby said.</p>
	<p>14 Housing is often the missing link for the clients Jose Bernal works with. Bernal, 28, is a program manager at Hospitality House. “I’ve connected people with medical services, therapy services — but when it comes to housing it’s just, it’s tough. What we do is we help them fill out applications, but essentially most of the time they’re getting put onto wait lists that are three years, five years, and when their name finally comes up, they’re still competing with other people. It breaks my heart. It really does.”</p>
