<h1>A window of opportunity for a regional approach</h1>

<p>By Gavin Newsom</p>

<p>There’s nothing like seeing yourself burned in effigy. My life-size self was set ablaze at 18th and Castro streets, the response of some who opposed my new strategy on homelessness. It was the reaction of people who preferred the status quo. But we forged ahead and developed a 10-year plan to tackle chronic homelessness by reorienting the system of care away from managing the problem and toward solving it. We aimed to break the cycle of dependency and move people into stable living situations.</p>

<p>We began by focusing on supportive housing. During my tenure, we moved people off the street — a 40 percent decrease in street homelessness. We helped move 12,391 people into permanent housing or back with family, aided by the completion of supportive-housing units and permanent supportive-housing units for homeless seniors. We laid the foundations for 2,827 more supportive-housing units, and added 67 units of homeless senior housing.</p>

<p>Underpinning the plan — and the fuel for my burning effigy — was “Care Not Cash,” a strategy that changed the dynamic of San Francisco’s failed approach to homelessness. To suppress homelessness, you have to repeal the policies that support it. “Care Not Cash” emphasized supportive housing and social services instead of cash-handout dependency. It reduced the number of active welfare cases by 83 percent. We redirected more than $14 million to place once cash-dependent homeless San Franciscans into housing.</p>

<p>We brought to scale Project Homeless Connect, a model that has been recognized and replicated globally, and served more than 33,000 homeless clients, delivering services such as dental care and eye exams through a volunteer army. The program addressed the basics: poor dental hygiene, the need for prescription eyeglasses and access to ID, which so often we found to be obstacles to employment, housing and government assistance.</p>

<p>Homeless Outreach Teams targeted hotspots like Golden Gate Park; we established veterans’ programs, women’s programs, senior programs and respite programs. All were designed to expand our reach and access to services. And we opened the <a href="http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/collaborative/community-justice" target="_blank">Community Justice Center</a> to address quality-of-life violations by redirecting people out the revolving door of the criminal justice system and into life-changing rehabilitation programs.</p>

<p>Ultimately, for all the energy invested and progress made on homelessness in San Francisco during my time as mayor, it was painfully clear that the city couldn’t do it on its own. It’s a myth that any city can end homelessness alone.</p>

<p>Like the other seemingly intractable challenges San Francisco faces — traffic and housing — holistic solutions to homelessness require coordination and support from the region and the state. Without that, one city’s policies will simply temporarily shift its problems to a neighbor.</p>

<p>Now is the time to take meaningful action, because we have bold, smart leaders at the state and regional level who understand what it takes.</p>

<p>In San Jose’s Sam Liccardo and Oakland’s Libby Schaaf, San Francisco has neighboring mayors who understand the power of regional solutions to take on tough challenges. At the state level, state Sen. Holly Mitchell, D-Los Angeles, has a bill (<a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1380" target="_blank">SB1380</a>) to create a state Interagency Council on Homelessness, which will allow California’s experts on homeless services to coordinate and trade our best ideas around the state.</p>

<p>If there were easy answers, then homelessness would have been solved years ago. But we must never be complacent about something this fundamental to a city’s humanity. We should take advantage of this unique moment to work for state and regional solutions that will help San Francisco and California.</p>
